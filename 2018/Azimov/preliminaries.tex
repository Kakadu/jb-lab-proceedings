\section{Background} \label{section_preliminaries}
In this section, we introduce the basic notions used throughout this work.

Let $\Sigma$ be a finite set of edge labels. Define an \textit{edge-labeled directed graph} as a tuple $D = (V, E)$ with a set of nodes $V$ and a directed edge-relation $E \subseteq V \times \Sigma \times V$.  For a path $\pi$ in a graph $D$, we denote the unique word obtained by concatenating the labels of the edges along the path $\pi$ as $l(\pi)$. Also, we write $n \pi m$ to indicate that a path $\pi$ starts at the node $n \in V$ and ends at the node $m \in V$.

Following Hellings~\cite{hellingsRelational}, we deviate from the usual definition of a context-free grammar in \textit{Chomsky Normal Form}~\cite{chomsky} by not including a special starting non-terminal, which will be specified in the path queries to the graph. Since every context-free grammar can be transformed into an equivalent one in Chomsky Normal Form and checking that an empty string is in the language is trivial it is sufficient to consider only grammars of the following type. A \textit{context-free grammar} is a triple $G = (N, \Sigma, P)$, where $N$ is a finite set of non-terminals, $\Sigma$ is a finite set of terminals, and $P$ is a finite set of productions of the following forms:

\begin{itemize}
    \item $A \rightarrow B C$, for $A,B,C \in N$,
    \item $A \rightarrow x$, for $A \in N$ and $x \in \Sigma$.   
\end{itemize}

Note that we omit the rules of the form $A \rightarrow \varepsilon$, where $\varepsilon$ denotes an empty string. This does not restrict the applicability of our algorithm because only the empty paths $m \pi m$ correspond to an empty string $\varepsilon$.

We use the conventional notation $A \xrightarrow{*} w$ to denote that a string $w \in \Sigma^*$ can be derived from a non-terminal $A$ by some sequence of applications of the production rules from $P$. The \textit{language} of a grammar $G = (N,\Sigma,P)$ with respect to a start non-terminal $S \in N$ is defined by $$L(G_S) = \{w \in \Sigma^*~|~S \xrightarrow{*} w\}.$$

For a given graph $D = (V, E)$ and a context-free grammar $G = (N, \Sigma, P)$, we define \textit{context-free relations} $R_A \subseteq V \times V$, for every $A \in N$, such that $$R_A = \{(n,m)~|~\exists n \pi m~(l(\pi) \in L(G_A))\}.$$

We define a binary operation $(~\cdot~)$ on arbitrary subsets $N_1 , N_2$ of $N$ with respect to a context-free grammar $G = (N, \Sigma, P)$ as $$N_1 \cdot N_2 = \{A~|~\exists B \in N_1, \exists C \in N_2 \text{ such that }(A \rightarrow B C) \in P\}.$$

Using this binary operation as a multiplication of subsets of $N$ and union of sets as an addition, we can define a \textit{matrix multiplication}, $a \times b = c$, where $a$ and $b$ are matrices of a suitable size that have subsets of $N$ as elements, as $$c_{i,j} = \bigcup^{n}_{k=1}{a_{i,k} \cdot b_{k,j}}.$$

According to Valiant~\cite{valiant}, we define the \textit{transitive closure} of a square matrix $a$ as $a^+ = a^{(1)}_+ \cup a^{(2)}_+ \cup \cdots$ where $a^{(1)}_+ = a$ and $$a^{(i)}_+ = \bigcup^{i-1}_{j=1}{a^{(j)}_+ \times a^{(i-j)}_+}, ~i \ge 2.$$

We enumerate the positions in the input string $s$ of Valiant's algorithm from 0 to the length of $s$. Valiant proposes the algorithm for computing this transitive closure only for upper triangular matrices, which is sufficient since for Valiant's algorithm the input is essentially a directed chain and for all possible paths $n \pi m$ in a directed chain $n < m$. In the context-free path querying input graphs can be arbitrary. For this reason, we need to compute the transitive closure of an arbitrary square matrix.

Also, the conjunctive grammars can be used in the path querying problems. Similar to the case of the context-free grammars, we deviate from the usual definition of a conjunctive grammar in the \textit{binary normal form}~\cite{okhotinConjAndBool} by not including a special start non-terminal, which will be specified in the queries to the graph. Since every conjunctive grammar can be transformed into an equivalent one in the binary normal form~\cite{okhotinConjAndBool} and checking that an empty string is in the language is trivial, then it is sufficient to only consider grammars of the following type. A \textit{conjunctive grammar} is 3-tuple $G = (N, \Sigma, P)$ where $N$ is a finite set of non-terminals, $\Sigma$ is a finite set of terminals, and $P$ is a finite set of productions of the following forms:

\begin{itemize}
	\item $A \rightarrow B_1 C_1~\& \ldots \&~B_m C_m$, for $m \geq 1$, $A,B_i,C_i \in N$,
	\item $A \rightarrow x$, for $A \in N$ and $x \in \Sigma$.   
\end{itemize}

For conjunctive grammars we also use the conventional notation $A \xrightarrow{*} w$ to denote that the string $w \in \Sigma^*$ can be derived from a non-terminal $A$ by some sequence of applying the production rules from $P$. The relation $\rightarrow$ is defined as follows:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Using a rule $A \rightarrow B_1 C_1~\& \ldots \&~B_m C_m \in P$, any atomic subterm $A$ of any term can be rewritten by the subterm $(B_1 C_1 ~\& \ldots \&~ B_m C_m)$:
	\begin{center}
		$\ldots A \ldots \rightarrow \ldots (B_1 C_1~\& \ldots \&~B_m C_m) \ldots$
	\end{center}
	\item A conjunction of several identical strings in $\Sigma^*$ can be rewritten by one such string: for every $w \in \Sigma^*$,
	\begin{center}
		$\ldots (w~\& \ldots \&~w) \ldots \rightarrow \ldots w \ldots$
	\end{center}
	
\end{itemize}

The \textit{language} of a conjunctive grammar $G = (N,\Sigma,P)$ with respect to a start non-terminal $S \in N$ is defined by $L(G_S) = \{w \in \Sigma^*~|~S \xrightarrow{*} w\}$.

For a given graph $D = (V, E)$ and a conjunctive grammar $G = (N, \Sigma, P)$, we define \textit{conjunctive relations} $R_A \subseteq V \times V$, for every $A \in N$, such that $R_A = \{(n,m)~|~\exists n \pi m~(l(\pi) \in L(G_A))\}$.
