\section{An algorithm for CFPQ using relational query semantics}
In this section, we show how the context-free path query evaluation using the relational query semantics can be reduced to the calculation of matrix transitive closure $a^{cf}$, prove the correctness of this reduction, introduce an algorithm for computing the transitive closure $a^{cf}$, and provide a step-by-step demonstration of this algorithm on a small example.

\subsection{Reducing CFPQ to transitive closure} \label{section_reducing}
In this section, we show how the context-free relations $R_A$ can be calculated by computing the matrix transitive closure $a^{cf}$.

We introduce another definition of the transitive closure of an arbitrary square matrix $a$ as $$a^{cf} = a^{(1)} \cup a^{(2)} \cup \cdots$$ where $a^{(1)} = a$ and $a^{(i)} = a^{(i-1)} \cup (a^{(i-1)} \times a^{(i-1)}), ~i \ge 2.$

To show that Valiant's and this definitions of the matrix transitive closure are equivalent, we introduce the partial order $\succeq$ on matrices with the fixed size which have subsets of $N$ as elements. For square matrices $a, b$ of the same size, we denote $a \succeq b$ iff $a_{i,j} \supseteq b_{i,j}$, for every $i, j$. For these two definitions of transitive closure, the following lemmas and theorem hold.

\begin{lemma}\label{lemma:cf_geq_valiant}
	Let $G =(N,\Sigma,P)$ be a grammar, let $a$ be a square matrix. Then $a^{(k)} \succeq a^{(k)}_+$ for any $k \geq 1$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}(Proof by Induction)
	
	\textbf{Basis}: The statement of the lemma holds for $k = 1$, since $$a^{(1)} = a^{(1)}_+ = a.$$
	
	\textbf{Inductive step}: Assume that the statement of the lemma holds for any $k \leq (p - 1)$ and show that it also holds for $k = p$ where $p \geq 2$. For any $i \geq 2$ $$a^{(i)} = a^{(i-1)} \cup (a^{(i-1)} \times a^{(i-1)}) \Rightarrow a^{(i)} \succeq a^{(i-1)}.$$ Hence, by the inductive hypothesis, for any $i \leq (p-1)$ $$a^{(p-1)} \succeq a^{(i)} \succeq a^{(i)}_+.$$ Let $1 \leq j \leq (p - 1)$. The following holds $$(a^{(p-1)} \times a^{(p-1)}) \succeq (a^{(j)}_+ \times a^{(p-j)}_+),$$ since $a^{(p-1)} \succeq a^{(j)}_+$ and $a^{(p-1)} \succeq a^{(p-j)}_+$. By the definition, $$a^{(p)}_+ = \bigcup^{p-1}_{j=1}{a^{(j)}_+ \times a^{(p-j)}_+}$$ and from this it follows that $$(a^{(p-1)} \times a^{(p-1)}) \succeq a^{(p)}_+.$$ By the definition, $$a^{(p)} = a^{(p-1)} \cup (a^{(p-1)} \times a^{(p-1)}) \Rightarrow a^{(p)} \succeq (a^{(p-1)} \times a^{(p-1)}) \succeq a^{(p)}_+$$ and this completes the proof of the lemma.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}\label{lemma:valiant_geq_cf}
	Let $G =(N,\Sigma,P)$ be a grammar, let $a$ be a square matrix. Then for any $k \geq 1$ there is $j \geq 1$, such that $(\bigcup^{j}_{i=1}{a^{(i)}_+}) \succeq a^{(k)}$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}(Proof by Induction)
	
	\textbf{Basis}: For $k = 1$ there is $j = 1$, such that $$a^{(1)}_+ = a^{(1)} = a.$$ Thus, the statement of the lemma holds for $k = 1$.
	
	\textbf{Inductive step}: Assume that the statement of the lemma holds for any $k \leq (p - 1)$ and show that it also holds for $k = p$ where $p \geq 2$. By the inductive hypothesis, there is $j \geq 1$, such that $$(\bigcup^{j}_{i=1}{a^{(i)}_+}) \succeq a^{(p-1)}.$$ By the definition, $$a^{(2j)}_+ = \bigcup^{2j-1}_{i=1}{a^{(i)}_+ \times a^{(2j-i)}_+}$$ and from this it follows that $$(\bigcup^{2j}_{i=1}{a^{(i)}_+}) \succeq (\bigcup^{j}_{i=1}{a^{(i)}_+}) \times (\bigcup^{j}_{i=1}{a^{(i)}_+}) \succeq (a^{(p-1)} \times a^{(p-1)}).$$ The following holds $$(\bigcup^{2j}_{i=1}{a^{(i)}_+}) \succeq a^{(p)} = a^{(p-1)} \cup (a^{(p-1)} \times a^{(p-1)}),$$ since $$(\bigcup^{2j}_{i=1}{a^{(i)}_+}) \succeq (\bigcup^{j}_{i=1}{a^{(i)}_+}) \succeq a^{(p-1)}$$ and $$(\bigcup^{2j}_{i=1}{a^{(i)}_+}) \succeq (a^{(p-1)} \times a^{(p-1)}).$$ Therefore there is $2j$, such that $$(\bigcup^{2j}_{i=1}{a^{(i)}_+}) \succeq a^{(p)}$$ and this completes the proof of the lemma.	
\end{proof}

\begin{mytheorem}\label{thm:closures}
	Let $G =(N,\Sigma,P)$ be a grammar, let $a$ be a square matrix. Then $a^+ = a^{cf}$.
\end{mytheorem}
\begin{proof}
	
	By the lemma~\ref{lemma:cf_geq_valiant}, for any $k \geq 1$, $a^{(k)} \succeq a^{(k)}_+$. Therefore $$a^{cf} = a^{(1)} \cup a^{(2)} \cup \cdots \succeq a^{(1)}_+ \cup a^{(2)}_+ \cup \cdots = a^+.$$ By the lemma~\ref{lemma:valiant_geq_cf}, for any $k \geq 1$ there is $j \geq 1$, such that $$(\bigcup^{j}_{i=1}{a^{(i)}_+}) \succeq a^{(k)}.$$ Hence $$a^+ = (\bigcup^{\infty}_{i=1}{a^{(i)}_+}) \succeq a^{(k)},$$ for any $k \geq 1$. Therefore $$a^+ \succeq a^{(1)} \cup a^{(2)} \cup \cdots = a^{cf}.$$ Since $a^{cf} \succeq a^+$ and $a^+ \succeq a^{cf}$, $$a^+ = a^{cf}$$ and this completes the proof of the theorem.
\end{proof}

Further, in this work, we use the transitive closure $a^{cf}$ instead of $a^+$ and, by the theorem~\ref{thm:closures}, an algorithm for computing $a^{cf}$ also computes Valiant's transitive closure $a^+$.

Let $G = (N,\Sigma,P)$ be a grammar and $D = (V, E)$ be a graph. We enumerate the nodes of the graph $D$ from 0 to $(|V| - 1)$. We initialize the elements of the $|V| \times |V|$ matrix $a$ with $\varnothing$. Further, for every $i$ and $j$ we set $$a_{i,j} = \{A_k~|~((i,x,j) \in E) \wedge ((A_k \rightarrow x) \in P)\}.$$ Finally, we compute the transitive closure $$a^{cf} = a^{(1)} \cup a^{(2)} \cup \cdots$$ where $$a^{(i)} = a^{(i-1)} \cup (a^{(i-1)} \times a^{(i-1)}),$$ for $i \ge 2$ and $a^{(1)} = a$. For the transitive closure $a^{cf}$, the following statements hold.

\begin{lemma}\label{lemma:cf}
Let $D = (V,E)$ be a graph, let $G =(N,\Sigma,P)$ be a grammar. Then for any $i, j$ and for any non-terminal $A \in N$, $A \in a^{(k)}_{i,j}$ iff $(i,j) \in R_A$ and $i \pi j$, such that there is a derivation tree of the height $h \leq k$ for the string $l(\pi)$ and a context-free grammar $G_A = (N,\Sigma,P,A)$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}(Proof by Induction)

\textbf{Basis}: Show that the statement of the lemma holds for $k = 1$. For any $i, j$ and for any non-terminal $A \in N$, $A \in a^{(1)}_{i,j}$ iff there is $i \pi j$ that consists of a unique edge $e$ from the node $i$ to the node $j$ and $(A \rightarrow x) \in P$ where $x = l(\pi)$. Therefore $(i,j) \in R_A$ and there is a derivation tree of the height $h = 1$, shown in Figure~\ref{tree1}, for the string $x$ and a context-free grammar $G_A = (N,\Sigma,P,A)$. Thus, it has been shown that the statement of the lemma holds for $k = 1$.

\begin{figure}[h!]
 \centering
 \includegraphics[width=0.2\textwidth]{pictures/tree1.pdf}
 \caption{The derivation tree of the height $h = 1$ for the string $x = l(\pi)$.}
 \label{tree1}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Inductive step}: Assume that the statement of the lemma holds for any $k \leq (p - 1)$ and show that it also holds for $k = p$ where $p \geq 2$. For any $i, j$ and for any non-terminal $A \in N$, $$A \in a^{(p)}_{i,j} \text{ iff } A \in a^{(p-1)}_{i,j} \text{ or } A \in (a^{(p-1)} \times a^{(p-1)})_{i,j},$$ since $$a^{(p)} = a^{(p-1)} \cup (a^{(p-1)} \times a^{(p-1)}).$$

Let $A \in a^{(p-1)}_{i,j}$. By the inductive hypothesis, $A \in a^{(p-1)}_{i,j}$ iff $(i,j) \in R_A$ and there exists $i \pi j$, such that there is a derivation tree of the height $h \leq (p-1)$ for the string $l(\pi)$ and a context-free grammar $G_A = (N,\Sigma,P,A)$. The statement of the lemma holds for $k = p$ since the height $h$ of this tree is also less than or equal to $p$.

Let $A \in (a^{(p-1)} \times a^{(p-1)})_{i,j}$. By the definition of the binary operation $(\cdot)$ on arbitrary subsets, $A \in (a^{(p-1)} \times a^{(p-1)})_{i,j}$ iff there are $r$, $B \in a^{(p-1)}_{i,r}$ and $C \in a^{(p-1)}_{r,j}$, such that $(A \rightarrow B C) \in P$. Hence, by the inductive hypothesis, there are $i \pi_1 r$ and $r \pi_2 j$, such that $(i,r) \in R_B$ and $(r,j) \in R_C$, and there are the derivation trees $T_B$ and $T_C$ of heights $h_1 \leq (p-1)$ and $h_2 \leq (p-1)$ for the strings $w_1 = l(\pi_1)$, $w_2 = l(\pi_2)$ and the context-free grammars $G_B$, $G_C$ respectively. Thus, the concatenation of paths $\pi_1$ and $\pi_2$ is $i \pi j$, where $(i,j) \in R_A$ and there is a derivation tree of the height $h = 1 + max(h_1, h_2)$, shown in Figure~\ref{tree2}, for the string $w = l(\pi)$ and a context-free grammar $G_A$.

\begin{figure}[h!]
 \centering
 \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{pictures/tree2.pdf}
 \caption{The derivation tree of the height $h = 1 + max(h_1, h_2)$ for the string $w = l(\pi)$, where $T_B$ and $T_C$ are the derivation trees for strings $w_1$ and $w_2$ respectively.}
 \label{tree2}
\end{figure}

The statement of the lemma holds for $k = p$ since the height $h = 1 + max(h_1, h_2) \leq p$. This completes the proof of the lemma.
\end{proof}

\begin{mytheorem}\label{thm:correct}
 Let $D = (V,E)$ be a graph and let $G =(N,\Sigma,P)$ be a grammar. Then for any $i, j$ and for any non-terminal $A \in N$, $A \in a^{cf}_{i,j}$ iff $(i,j) \in R_A$.
\end{mytheorem}
\begin{proof}

Since the matrix $a^{cf} = a^{(1)} \cup a^{(2)} \cup \cdots,$ for any $i, j$ and for any non-terminal $A \in N$, $A \in a^{cf}_{i,j}$ iff there is $k \geq 1$, such that $A \in a^{(k)}_{i,j}$. By the lemma~\ref{lemma:cf}, $A \in a^{(k)}_{i,j}$ iff $(i,j) \in R_A$ and there is $i \pi j$, such that there is a derivation tree of the height $h \leq k$ for the string $l(\pi)$ and a context-free grammar $G_A = (N,\Sigma,P,A)$. This completes the proof of the theorem.
\end{proof}

We can, therefore, determine whether $(i,j) \in R_A$ by asking whether $A \in a^{cf}_{i,j}$. Thus, we show how the context-free relations $R_A$ can be calculated by computing the transitive closure $a^{cf}$ of the matrix $a$.



\subsection{The algorithm} \label{section_algorithm}
In this section, we introduce an algorithm for calculating the transitive closure $a^{cf}$ which was discussed in Section~\ref{section_reducing}.

Let $D = (V, E)$ be the input graph and $G = (N,\Sigma,P)$ be the input grammar.

\begin{algorithm}[H]
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\caption{Context-free recognizer for graphs}
\label{alg:graphParse}
\Function{contextFreePathQuerying}{D, G}
    
    \State{$n \gets$ the number of nodes in $D$}
    \State{$E \gets$ the directed edge-relation from $D$}
    \State{$P \gets$ the set of production rules in $G$}
    \State{$T \gets$ the matrix $n \times n$ in which each element is $\varnothing$}
    \ForAll{$(i,x,j) \in E$}
    \Comment{Matrix initialization}
        \State{$T_{i,j} \gets T_{i,j} \cup \{A~|~(A \rightarrow x) \in P \}$}
    \EndFor    
    \While{matrix $T$ is changing}
       
        \State{$T \gets T \cup (T \times T)$}
        \Comment{Transitive closure $T^{cf}$ calculation} 
    \EndWhile
\State \Return $T$
\EndFunction
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

Note that the matrix initialization in lines \textbf{6-7} of the Algorithm~\ref{alg:graphParse} can handle arbitrary graph $D$. For example, if a graph $D$ contains multiple edges $(i,x_1,j)$ and $(i,x_2,j)$ then both the elements of the set $\{A~|~(A \rightarrow x_1) \in P \}$ and the elements of the set $\{A~|~(A \rightarrow x_2) \in P \}$ will be added to $T_{i,j}$.

We need to show that the Algorithm~\ref{alg:graphParse} terminates in a finite number of steps. Since each element of the matrix $T$ contains no more than $|N|$ non-terminals, the total number of non-terminals in the matrix $T$ does not exceed $|V|^2|N|$. Therefore, the following theorem holds.

\begin{mytheorem}\label{thm:finite}
 Let $D = (V,E)$ be a graph and let $G =(N,\Sigma,P)$ be a grammar. The Algorithm~\ref{alg:graphParse} terminates in a finite number of steps. 
\end{mytheorem}
\begin{proof}
It is sufficient to show, that the operation in the line \textbf{9} of the Algorithm~\ref{alg:graphParse} changes the matrix $T$ only finite number of times. Since this operation can only add non-terminals to some elements of the matrix $T$, but not remove them, it can change the matrix $T$ no more than $|V|^2|N|$ times.
\end{proof}

Denote the number of elementary operations executed by the algorithm of multiplying two $n \times n$ Boolean matrices as $BMM(n)$. According to Valiant, the matrix multiplication operation in the line \textbf{9} of the Algorithm~\ref{alg:graphParse} can be calculated in $O(|N|^2 BMM(|V|))$. Denote the number of elementary operations executed by the matrix union operation of two $n \times n$ Boolean matrices as $BMU(n)$. Similarly, it can be shown that the matrix union operation in the line \textbf{9} of the Algorithm~\ref{alg:graphParse} can be calculated in $O(|N|^2 BMU(n))$. Since the line \textbf{9} of the Algorithm~\ref{alg:graphParse} is executed no more than $|V|^2|N|$ times, the following theorem holds.

\begin{mytheorem}\label{thm:time}
 Let $D = (V,E)$ be a graph and let $G =(N,\Sigma,P)$ be a grammar. The Algorithm~\ref{alg:graphParse} calculates the transitive closure $T^{cf}$ in $O(|V|^2|N|^3(BMM(|V|) + BMU(|V|)))$.
\end{mytheorem}

We also provide the worst-case example, for which the time complexity in terms of the graph size provided by Theorem~\ref{thm:time} cannot be improved. This example is based on the context-free grammar $G = (N, \Sigma, P)$ where:
\begin{itemize}
	\item the set of non-terminals $N = \{S\}$;
	\item the set of terminals $\Sigma = \{a, b\}$;
	\item the set of production rules $P$ is presented on Figure~\ref{ProductionRulesWorsCaseExample}.
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[h]
	\[
	\begin{array}{rccl}
	0: & S & \rightarrow & \text{\emph{a}} \ S \ \text{\emph{b}} \\
	1: & S & \rightarrow & \text{\emph{a}} \ \text{\emph{b}} \\ 
	\end{array}
	\]
	\caption{Production rules for the worst-case example.}
	\label{ProductionRulesWorsCaseExample}
\end{figure}

Let the size $|N|$ of the grammar $G$ be a constant. The worst-case time complexity is reached by running this query on the double-cyclic graph where:
\begin{itemize}
	\item one of the cycles having $u = 2^k + 1$ edges labeled with $a$;
	\item another cycle having $v = 2^k$ edges labeled with $b$;
	\item the two cycles are connected via a shared node $m$.
\end{itemize}

A small example of such graph with $k = 1$, $u = 3$, $v = 2$, and $m = 0$ is presented on Figure~\ref{worst_case_graph}.

\begin{figure}[h]
	\[
	\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{pictures/worst_case_graph.pdf}
	\]
	\caption{An example of the graph for the worst-case time complexity.}
	\label{worst_case_graph}
\end{figure}

The shortest path $\pi$ from the node $m$ to the node $m$, whose labeling forms a string from the language $L(G_S)=\{a^n b^n; n \geq 1\}$, has a length $l = 2*u*v$, since $u = 2^k + 1$ and $v = 2^k$ are coprime, and string $s$, formed by this path, consists of $u*v$ labels $a$ and $u*v$ labels $b$. The string $s = l(\pi)$ has a derivation tree according to a context-free grammar $G_S$ of the minimal height $h = 2*u*v$ among all the paths from the node $m$ to the node $m$ in this double-cyclic graph. Therefore, if we run the worst-case example query on this graph, then the operation in the line \textbf{9} of the Algorithm~\ref{alg:graphParse} changes the matrix $T$ at least $h = 2*u*v$ times. Hence, the Algorithm~\ref{alg:graphParse} computes this query in $O(|V|^2(BMM(|V|) + BMU(|V|)))$, since $|V| = (u + v - 1) = 2*v$ and $h = 2*u*v > 2*v*v = |V|^2 / 4 = O(|V|^2)$.


\subsection{An example} \label{section_example}
In this section, we provide a step-by-step demonstration of the proposed algorithm. For this, we consider the classical \textit{same-generation query}~\cite{FndDB}.

The \textbf{example query} is based on the context-free grammar $G = (N, \Sigma, P)$ where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The set of non-terminals $N = \{S\}$.
    \item The set of terminals $$\Sigma = \{subClassOf, subClassOf^{-1}, type, type^{-1}\}.$$
    \item The set of production rules $P$ is presented in Figure~\ref{ProductionRulesExampleQuery}.
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[h]
   \[
\begin{array}{rccl}
   0: & S & \rightarrow & \text{\textit{subClassOf}}^{-1} \ S \ \text{\textit{subClassOf}} \\ 
   1: & S & \rightarrow & \text{\textit{type}}^{-1} \ S \ \text{\textit{type}} \\ 
   2: & S & \rightarrow & \text{\textit{subClassOf}}^{-1} \ \text{\textit{subClassOf}} \\ 
   3: & S & \rightarrow & \text{\textit{type}}^{-1} \ \text{\textit{type}} \\ 
\end{array}
\]
\caption{Production rules for the example query grammar.}
\label{ProductionRulesExampleQuery}
\end{figure}

Since the proposed algorithm processes only grammars in Chomsky normal form, we first transform the grammar $G$ into an equivalent grammar $G' = (N', \Sigma', P')$ in normal form, where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The set of non-terminals $N' = \{S, S_1, S_2, S_3, S_4, S_5, S_6\}$.
    \item The set of terminals $$\Sigma' = \{subClassOf, subClassOf^{-1}, type, type^{-1}\}.$$
    \item The set of production rules $P'$ is presented in Figure~\ref{ProductionRulesExampleQueryCNF}.
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[h]
   \[
\begin{array}{rccl}
   0: & S & \rightarrow & S_1 \ S_5 \\
   1: & S & \rightarrow & S_3 \ S_6 \\
   2: & S & \rightarrow & S_1 \ S_2 \\
   3: & S & \rightarrow & S_3 \ S_4 \\
   4: & S_5 & \rightarrow & S \ S_2 \\
   5: & S_6 & \rightarrow & S \ S_4 \\
   6: & S_1 & \rightarrow & \text{\textit{subClassOf}}^{-1} \\ 
   7: & S_2 & \rightarrow & \text{\textit{subClassOf}} \\ 
   8: & S_3 & \rightarrow & \text{\textit{type}}^{-1} \\
   9: & S_4 & \rightarrow & \text{\textit{type}} \\ 
\end{array}
\]
\caption{Production rules for the example query grammar in normal form.}
\label{ProductionRulesExampleQueryCNF}
\end{figure}

We run the query on a graph presented in Figure~\ref{ExampleQueryGraph}.

\begin{figure}[h]
\[
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{pictures/ExampleGraph.pdf}
\]
\caption{An input graph for the example query.}
\label{ExampleQueryGraph}
\end{figure}

We provide a step-by-step demonstration of the work with the given graph $D$ and grammar $G'$ of the Algorithm~\ref{alg:graphParse}. After the matrix initialization in lines \textbf{6-7} of the Algorithm~\ref{alg:graphParse}, we have a matrix $T_0$ presented in Figure~\ref{ExampleQueryInitMatrix}.

\begin{figure}[h]
\[
T_0 = \begin{pmatrix}
    \{S_1\} & \{S_3\} & \varnothing \\ \varnothing & \varnothing & \{S_3\} \\ \{S_2\} & \varnothing & \{S_4\}
\end{pmatrix}
\]
\caption{The initial matrix for the example query.}
\label{ExampleQueryInitMatrix}
\end{figure}

Let $T_i$ be the matrix $T$ obtained after executing the loop in lines \textbf{8-9} of the Algorithm~\ref{alg:graphParse} $i$ times. The calculation of the matrix $T_1$ is shown in Figure~\ref{ExampleQueryFirstIteration}.

\begin{figure}[h]
\[
T_0 \times T_0 = \begin{pmatrix}
    \varnothing & \varnothing & \varnothing \\ \varnothing & \varnothing & \{S\} \\ \varnothing & \varnothing & \varnothing
\end{pmatrix}
\]

\[
T_1 = T_0 \cup (T_0 \times T_0) = \begin{pmatrix}
    \{S_1\} & \{S_3\} & \varnothing \\ \varnothing & \varnothing & \{S_3, S\} \\ \{S_2\} & \varnothing & \{S_4\}
\end{pmatrix}
\]
\caption{The first iteration of computing the transitive closure for the example query.}
\label{ExampleQueryFirstIteration}
\end{figure}

When the algorithm at some iteration finds new paths in the graph $D$, then it adds corresponding nonterminals to the matrix $T$. For example, after the first loop iteration, non-terminal $S$ is added to the matrix $T$. This non-terminal is added to the element with a row index $i = 1$ and a column index $j = 2$. This means that there is $i\pi j$ (a path $\pi$ from the node 1 to the node 2), such that $S \xrightarrow{*} l(\pi)$. For example, such a path consists of two edges with labels $type^{-1}$ and $type$, and thus $S \xrightarrow{*} type^{-1} \ type$.

The calculation of the transitive closure is completed after $k$ iterations when a fixpoint is reached: $T_{k-1} = T_k$. For the example query, $k = 6$ since $T_6 = T_5$. The remaining iterations of computing the transitive closure are presented in Figure~\ref{ExampleQueryFinalIterations}.

\begin{figure}[h]
\[
T_2 = \begin{pmatrix}
    \{S_1\} & \{S_3\} & \varnothing \\ \{S_5\} & \varnothing & \{S_3, S, S_6\} \\ \{S_2\} & \varnothing & \{S_4\}
\end{pmatrix}
\]

\[
T_3 = \begin{pmatrix}
    \{S_1\} & \{S_3\} & \{S\} \\ \{S_5\} & \varnothing & \{S_3, S, S_6\} \\ \{S_2\} & \varnothing & \{S_4\}
\end{pmatrix}
\]

\[
T_4 = \begin{pmatrix}
    \{S_1, S_5\} & \{S_3\} & \{S, S_6\} \\ \{S_5\} & \varnothing & \{S_3, S, S_6\} \\ \{S_2\} & \varnothing & \{S_4\}
\end{pmatrix}
\]

\[
T_5 = \begin{pmatrix}
    \{S_1, S_5, S\} & \{S_3\} & \{S, S_6\} \\ \{S_5\} & \varnothing & \{S_3, S, S_6\} \\ \{S_2\} & \varnothing & \{S_4\}
\end{pmatrix}
\]
\caption{Remaining states of the matrix $T$.}
\label{ExampleQueryFinalIterations}
\end{figure}

Thus, the result of the Algorithm~\ref{alg:graphParse} for the example query is the matrix $T_5 = T_6$. Now, after constructing the transitive closure, we can construct the context-free relations $R_A$. These relations for each non-terminal of the grammar $G'$ are presented in Figure~\ref{ExampleQueryCFRelations}.

\begin{figure}[h]
\begin{eqnarray*}
R_S&=&\{(0,0),(0,2),(1,2)\},\\
R_{S_1}&=&\{(0,0)\},\\
R_{S_2}&=&\{(2,0)\}, \\
R_{S_3}&=&\{(0,1), (1,2)\}, \\
R_{S_4}&=&\{(2,2)\}, \\
R_{S_5}&=&\{(0,0), (1,0)\}, \\
R_{S_6}&=&\{(0,2), (1,2)\}.
\end{eqnarray*}
\caption{Context-free relations for the example query.}
\label{ExampleQueryCFRelations}
\end{figure}

By the context-free relation $R_S$, we can conclude that there are paths in a graph $D$ only from the node 0 to the node 0, from the node 0 to the node 2 or from the node 1 to the node 2, corresponding to the context-free grammar $G_S$. This conclusion is based on the fact that a grammar $G'_S$ is equivalent to the grammar $G_S$ and $L(G_S) = L(G_S')$.
