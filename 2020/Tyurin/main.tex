\begin{abstract}
	The optimization of GPGPU programs has steadily received close attention 
	in the research community since applications ought to be more effective,
	 less memory consuming, and easier to program.
	  Partial evaluation in turn is a tool that could automatically bring performance leveraging the static nature of the application inputs.
	   This work aims to combine partial evaluation and GPGPU programs to make the latter more memory efficient.
It analyses whether any performance gain could be achieved via
 data access embedding achieved by partial evaluation and identifies GPU-specific details that affect the effectiveness of partial evaluation.
