Context-free path querying involves using context-free grammars to set path constraints in a graph. This problem arises in areas such as static code analysis and RDF data analysis. However, no graph database supports queries with context-free constraints, which hinders the development of application solutions. This paper presents a solution to this problem and provides support for the Cypher query language extended with the necessary constructs for the graph database RedisGraph.
